			<section itemprop="entry-text">
				<p>The Fac&rsquo;ar are the most militant species in the entire known universe, and have a policy of colonize, assimilate,
decimate any planet that serves their purposes.</p>

<p>The species is ancient, having existed for 10,000 years.  About 5000 years ago, they achieved inter-stellar technology
and began to explore and colonize nearby star systems.  They all but abandoned their original home world and settled a
larger planet, named Fac&rsquo;ar Major, and covered every inch of the planet with Fac&rsquo;arian technology. Fac&rsquo;ar Major contains a sun that only emits ultraviolet light, though they can adjust to visible wavelengths, but only
on that range of the color spectrum.  They cannot see light in wavelengths shorter than blue.</p>

<p>The Fac&rsquo;ar believe they are the chosen people of the Rastraga (rah-STRAH-ga), their supreme diety, a faceless bird like
creature with large razor sharp feathers.  As such, they believe they rule, above all, with absolute agency in the name
of Rastraga.</p>

<p>The Fac&rsquo;ar are a matriarchy, with an Empress as the embodiment of Rastraga, who channels and speaks as Rastraga.  They
believe that Rastraga possess the Empress when she is in her trance of channeling.  In reality, the trance is brought on
by a paralytic hallucinogen that is contained in the sacred tea that is consumed during religion rituals.</p>

<p>The Fac&rsquo;ar, as rightful &ldquo;stewards&rdquo; of the universe, enslave numerous species across the universe.  Humans were discovered
by the Fac&rsquo;ar early in their history, and the Empress, Mak&rsquo;Hera Wan, decreed that Earth would be left intact as a
supervised breeding colony.  Mak&rsquo;Hera Wan studied the humans&rsquo; lust for violence, and decided they would be harvested
as faithful assassins and trained warriors of the Lian-Che.</p>

<p>The Fac&rsquo;ar are giant lemur-like creatures that average about 7 feet in height, and are covered in purple fur, though
the fur absorbs light of other wavelengths and retransmits them back in the purple and ultraviolet wavelengths, so
they always appear to glow.</p>

<p>Mating for the Fac&rsquo;ar is a detailed and complex ritual of religious rights, chanting, and blood sacrifice (their own).
Because of this, the Fac&rsquo;ar rarely mate with other Fac&rsquo;ar.  Given the nature of their mating, they have developed cloning
and gene manipulation technology that allows them to create offspring in the lab, but every Fac&rsquo;ar is expected to produce
at least one offspring through natural means once they come of age.  They will, however, engage in sex with other species
purely for pleasure, and have large prostitution trade on one of the minor outer moons of Fac&rsquo;ar Major.</p>

<p>Because the Fac&rsquo;ar live for hundreds of years, they do not reach the age of maturity until they have surpassed 100 years
according to the calendar on Fac&rsquo;ar Major, which is equivalent to 0.97 earth-years.  Before their 100th year, they are
not allowed to perform the mating ritual, nor are they allowed to be cell donors for the cloning and gene manipulation
process.  They are not forbidden to partake in any other activities.</p>

<p>The Fac&rsquo;arian empire is in a state of turmoil as the Empress, Gre&rsquo;Hera Lei, was assassinated by a rogue member of the
Lian-Che, who escaped before being brought to justice.  The Dan&rsquo;sto, the royal scientists, are working around the clock
to regenerated Lei before Rastraga is lost forever.</p>
