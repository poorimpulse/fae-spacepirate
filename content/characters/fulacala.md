title = "Tema, Silorsa refugee"
+++
Tema was born FulaCala. Like many of the Cireon, FulaCala is masculine in dress and
appearance, preferring short hair, simple, unadorned clothes, and no decorations on his collar. (When speaking
English, he prefers the masculine pronouns.)

He was born in the Fatala as a mating between FulaMa and FulaSima, an illegally pair-bonded Toreon and Lareon who
were turned in by their families for dishonor of the unnatural variety.

Upon his birth, he was removed from the Fatala and became a ward of the council, where he was raised with strict
discipline and harsh punishments.  Upon his age day, the date when Fireons are granted 100% legal recognition as
an independent being, FulaCala decided to take a new name, Tema, and signed on as a sailor on the starship Ome, bound
for a distant settlement on the outer reaches of the star system.
