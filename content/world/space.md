Space exists as it exists in the real world, however, the human race has managed to colonize Mars as
research station for longer term colonization.  Very few humans live outside of the orbit of Sol.

### Mars Station

Mars Station is a research facility for advanced colonization techniques.  Created by `Mars Unity`, this facility is
a host to experiments for long term exoplanet colonization.  There are currently 10,000 researchers, engineers, and
volunteer colonizers living and working on a 100 year mission.  Escape vehicles and a orbiting, AI-controlled rescue
transport ship are their safety plan.

### Exoplanets

#### Silorsa Major

Silorsa Major is the home world of the Fireon, a warmongering race of bipedal felines, who command a vast armada of
small, agile and deadly starships.  The planet itself is a lush, verdant world with large meadows, raging rivers.  It
contains a single land mass that is called Simta, and the vast ocean that surrounds Simta is called Winra.
