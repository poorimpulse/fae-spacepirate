The multitudes are infinite.  Higher life forms take all shapes and sizes.  If it can be imagined, it exists in the
universe.  A species of bipedal feline warriors from the planet Silorsa Major, sure why not?  Unless the species has something
extraordinary about them (e.g. thermal vision, subsonic hearing, etc.)  The species of a character in Space Pirate is
wide open.

If the species has some extraordinary aspect to them, the characters of that species must take a stunt or aspect to back
up that extraordinary feature of the species, or come up with a narrative reason why no bonus is granted for having that
characteristic.

See the [NPC List](../characters) to see examples of how a species with extraordinary characteristics can be made.

### Known Species

#### The Fireon

The Fireon are bipedal felines.  They are rules by a council of seven elders, from the seven tribes of the Fireon.
The Fireon are skilled warriors, fierce and deadly should someone cross their path.  While skilled at starship combat,
they shine particularly at hand to hand fighting, preferring bladed weapons over any other kinds.

Their species contains three distinct genders called the Toreon, Lareon, and the Cireon.  Any combination of the two are
capable of producing offspring, but the species tends towards not pair-bonding, but tri-bonding. They have a ceremony
for bonding known as donta-fara-sheon, which involves sharing in each others blood.  The tri-bonding is permanent, for
life, but a Fireon is not expected to tri-bond.  When one member of the tri-bond dies, it is expected that the other
two Fireon will take part in the ritual of danto-fara-sheon, which is a form of ritual suicide to join their trimate
in the afterlife.

The Fireon have no codified religion, but they believe there is a world after death, and honor is the highest virtue.
When a Fireon has lost their honor, they are expected to shave all of their fur off, forsake all posessions, including
clothes, and live in the Fatala, a sandy expanse of land on the southern tip of Simta.  Fatala contains a temple from
 the ancient times, dedicated to some god that has long since forgotten.  The Fatala tradition of attonement for dishonor
 is the only vestiges of the religion.
