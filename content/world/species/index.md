title = "Species"

The multitudes are infinite.  Higher life forms take all shapes and sizes.  If it can be imagined, it exists in the
universe.  A species of bipedal feline warriors from the planet Silorsa Major, sure why not?  Unless the species has something
extraordinary about them (e.g. thermal vision, subsonic hearing, etc.)  The species of a character in Space Pirate is
wide open.

If the species has some extraordinary aspect to them, the characters of that species must take a stunt or aspect to back
up that extraordinary feature of the species, or come up with a narrative reason why no bonus is granted for having that
characteristic.

See the [NPC List](../characters) to see examples of how a species with extraordinary characteristics can be made.
