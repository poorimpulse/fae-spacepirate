The Ca’hei Lan are one of several genetically-modified species of human origin created by the Fac’ar - who have a
long history of kidnapping humans from Earth. Humans have long been seen as a viable species for genetic
experimentation, due to a relatively simple DNA structure, and their primitive status in the evolutionary chain.

Early explorers sent to monitor Earth for harvesting noted that the human species had a predisposition towards sex and
violence. This was seen as a feature to be exploited, and the earliest Ca’hei Lan were designed to serve two purposes:
providing pleasure in the harems of Fac’ar nobles, and entertainment in the ‘gladiator rings’ of the Fac’ar government.
The species was bred on an outpost moon of the Fac’ar homeworld, with changes made to the human DNA structure that both
enhanced sexual drive, strength, and drive to attack when presented with a ‘fight or flight’ circumstance. This made
them into headstrong fighters and intense lovers.

The major change to the human genetic sequence was the change to sex and gender. The Ca’hei Lan have no gender, but
are rather two-in-one: hermaphroditic, they present as so until puberty, at which time they gain the ability to change
from one gender to the other (taking on the traditional appearance and reproductive organs of the classic ‘female’
and ‘male’ genders of humans). They are technically both at once, but can ‘present’ as one or the other as they
choose; they accomplish this by moving bone structure and muscle/fat mass, much the way that an octopus might change
the color or texture of their skin. Each Ca’hei Lan has their own strength at making the change: for some it can be
instantaneous, and for others it can take up to several minutes. Additionally, not all Ca’hei Lan choose to switch
between the two ‘genders’; some prefer one form over the other, while others may change several times a day. The only
time they might switch back to their hermaphroditic ‘bi-gender’ appearance held before puberty is when sleeping or
unconscious; the ability to hold one of either form is a subconscious, not conscious, one - but sometimes a Ca’hei
Lan reverts when not fully conscious. Again, this can vary from Ca’hei Lan to Ca’hei Lan.
 
Aside from the change to gender and enhanced sexual drive and ‘attack mode’, there are almost no visible differences
between a Ca’hei Lan and a generic human. The few minor features that are present are a commonly androgynous look,
unusual eye colors (yellow, lavender, etc.), and the absence of body hair, other than on the top of the head
(meaning ‘male’ presenting Ca’hei Lan are incapable of growing facial hair).

Ca’hei Lan have a culture created primarily around their existence as slaves and rebels of the Fac’ar state.
During the ages of breeding on the outpost moon, Ca’hei Lan were forbidden from mating or marrying their own kind;
they were seen as possessions, and could be bought and sold and separated at any time. This did not stop some of the
Ca’hei Lan from taking on secret lovers or mates, but resulted in a culture that placed no value on ‘marriage’.
Additionally, the lack of more than one ‘gender’ in the species resulted in an open-mindedness to mating and physical
forms. The Ca’hei Lan are a largely polysexual, polyamorous species, that prefer casual relationships or lovers to
monogamy or commitment; of course, there are those that break this mold, but almost all committed relationships
with a Ca’hei Lan occur when they are mated to a being of another species, and are always entirely based on the other
species’s views/culture/religion (having no cultural equivalent to ‘commitment’ or ‘marriage’ themselves).

Nearly 2,000 years after the first Ca’hei Lan were bred, a resistance rose up on the outpost moon where the species was
primarily stationed before being sold off to various noble houses or the state. A war erupted, ending with the deaths
of nearly 1/3 of all Ca’hei Lan on the moon; the rest killed their breeders and guardians, escaping on any vessels
available to them. The Ca’hei Lan became enemies of the Fac’ar state, and most are executed upon sight, even to this
day. Several members of the Fac’ar are more ambivalent about their one-time creations and slaves, and consider the
Ca’hei Lan pests and nothing more.

Due to the lack of a homeworld, Ca’hei Lan are almost always born in space and many live their entire lives on
spaceships; this makes them extremely handy at navigation, piloting, and mechanics. Having a Ca’hei Lan on board is
considered somewhat lucky; they are rather rare in the galaxy.
