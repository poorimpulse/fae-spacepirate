			<h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline">Sydney Daniels, AKA Starbaby</h1>
			<section itemprop="entry-text">
				<p>Sydney Daniels was born in Iowa on a farm just outside of Des Moines.  Her family owned the farm until she was five, when
they had to sell it to a large commercial agriculture company.  They were allowed to continue to live on the farm and
work the fields, but the company was taking most of the profit.</p>

<p>Sydney was seven years old when the Fac&rsquo;ar abducted her from her house. She was given as a present to the empress of the
Fac&rsquo;ar, Gra&rsquo;hera Lei, where she was treated as a servant girl until she was old enough to be trained as a member of the
Lian-Che, the royal assassins of the Fac&rsquo;ar Empire.</p>

<p>She quickly rose to through the ranks of the Lian-Che, becoming the personal bodyguard of Gra&rsquo;hera Lei.  When the Fac&rsquo;ar
declared war on the Walanti, and the Lian-Che were sent to rid the Walanti of their Magorice, Sydney remained behind
to protect Gra&rsquo;hera Lei, but Sydney had other plans.  During the sleeping times, Sydney slipped into Gra&rsquo;hera Lei&rsquo;s
chambers, and ran her through with a dark blade, ending her life in the quiet of the night.</p>

<p>Then, she stole a small transport ship and escaped the Fac&rsquo;ar&rsquo;s grasp, but she knows she isn&rsquo;t safe.  She has taken the
moniker &ldquo;Starbaby&rdquo; in the hopes that the Fac&rsquo;ar will not be able to trace her.  She ditched the ship on a small outpost
moon in the Silvanis System.</p>
